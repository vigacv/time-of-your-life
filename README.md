# Time of your Life

## Description

Time of Your Life is a project that will always be in "progress".  It's got a little bit of a start, but is intentionally left with need of feature implementations to get it to an [MVP] state.

## How to Develop

Time of Your Life is built on these technologies:

- [.NET 8]
- [React JS]

To develop on this project clone this project, and open with an IDE of your choice. VS Code or Visual Studio 2019 or newer is recommended.

The project can be run from the command line using the command `dotnet run`.  The service and application hosting can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl+C` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd+C` on macOS.

Changes to the React Client Side SPA, will be reflected in the UI in a hot load manner. Changes to the .Net server components will require a recompile, `dotnet build` and restart, `dotnet run`.

## TODOs

### Easier

#### Client

- [ ] Make the title of the clock customizable

- [ ] Make a return character in the text settings fields save the field property value

- [ ] Add validation to the text input fields

- [ ] Display the list of the presets saved on the server served from this endpoint:

  `GET: https://localhost:7154/clock/presets`

- [ ] Add sync to the server time

#### Server

- [ ] Add preset save validation
- [ ] Add a unique identifier for a preset either an auto number value or a GUID
- [ ] Add sync to the server time

### Medium-er

#### Client

- [ ] Make the clock `Set Clock Props` panel expandable and collapsible
- [ ] Make the font size selection a slider control
- [ ] Make the colors of the title and the clock different color values
- [ ] Save the presets to the server at this endpoint:
  `POST: https://localhost:7154/clock/presets`
- [ ] Select a preset from the list saved on the server to replace the current values and update the clock
- [ ] Add unit tests

#### Server

- [ ] Return a preset by the title ID
- [ ] Add the ability to update existing presets with changes in values
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add `ClockController` logging

### Harder

#### Client

- [ ] Add a color picker to select the font colors for multiple colors
- [ ] Add the ability to print the time out in text, i.e. "1:32 PM" would be printed out as "one thirty two PM"
- [ ] Add an alarms control/presets
- [ ] Add a testing results output report

#### Server

- [ ] Implement a [sqlite] database storage layer
- [ ] Save alarms and populate the alarms on the clock
- [ ] Add a testing results output report
